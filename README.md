# Memrise Learning Retries

This userscript stops words from dropping out of the session when 'planting' them in a learning session. If you answer incorrectly, you are given a reminder of the answer after which you get another go at answering. Subsequently, all words are fully planted at the end of the session.

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

- Chrome: install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension
- Firefox: install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-learning-retries/raw/master/Memrise_Learning_Retries.user.js
